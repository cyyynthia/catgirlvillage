# Cynthia's SMP modpack
This is the modpack of my private SMP, Catgirl Village, released as a public modpack so anyone can have fun with it
as well with their friends & what not.

This modpack is focused on providing a beautiful, realistic-ish experience with a lot of new biomes, new mobs, nature
mods, enhanced natural structures, seasons, lots of new decoration blocks & props, and more. It features a revamped
audio experience for an even more immersive and pleasant experience. With, of course, Create to bring a little bit of
steam-punk vibe to the modpack and trains! Who doesn't like trains?

The configuration of the modpack is tailored to discourage, or outright prevent try-hard gameplay. The core spirit is
to encourage players to enjoy a more role-play play style, make railway the go-to transportation method, etc.

This modpack runs on Minecraft 1.20.1 and Forge 47.2.20.
